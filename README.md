Github_Hook
===========

A very simple github hook helper which original from 
http://godoc.org/github.com/phayes/hookserve/ . But I just think the
original repo event parsing was written inside the service, and cannot
be customized by user. So I just clean the code, and add a custom 
EventHandler for it.
